    <h1>ðŸ”® Crystal Cave Exploration ðŸ”®</h1>
    <p>The moment you step into the crystal cave, the air grows colder, and the walls sparkle with countless embedded crystals. Each step you take sends echoes through the vast, glittering cavern. The ground beneath your feet crunches with tiny crystal shards, and beams of refracted light dance on the walls.</p>
    <p>As you venture deeper, you find mysterious markings on the walls. Could they be clues left by an ancient civilization? Or are they warnings?</p>
    <p>What will you do next?</p>
